#The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:
# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.


a= int(input("Enter a number: "))
b = int(input("Enter another number: "))
print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {a+b}")
print(f"The difference of {a} and {b} is {a-b}")
print(f"The product of {a} and {b} is {a*b}")
