# Task2_Q5

# Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:
# insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
# print: Print the list.
# remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
# append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
# sort: Sort the list.
# pop: Pop the last element from the list.
# reverse: Reverse the list.
# Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.
