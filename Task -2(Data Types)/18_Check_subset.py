# Task2_Q18
# You are given two sets, A and B.
# Your job is to find whether set A is a subset of set B.
# If set A is subset of set B, print True.
# If set A is not a subset of set B, print False.

# Input Format
# The first line will contain the number of test cases, T.
# The first line of each test case contains the number of elements in set A.
# The second line of each test case contains the space separated elements of set A.
# The third line of each test case contains the number of elements in set B.
# The fourth line of each test case contains the space separated elements of setB .
