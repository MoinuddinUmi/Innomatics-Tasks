# Task2_Q19
# You are given a set A and n other sets.
# Your job is to find whether set A is a strict superset of each of the N sets.
# Print True, if A is a strict superset of each of the N sets. Otherwise, print False.
# A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.

# Input Format
# The first line contains the space separated elements of set A.
# The second line contains integer n, the number of other sets.
# The next n lines contains the space separated elements of the other sets.
