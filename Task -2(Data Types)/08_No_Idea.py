# Task2_Q8
# There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each containing m integers. 
# You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0. 
# For each i integer in the array, if i in A, you add 1 to your happiness. If i in B, you add -1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.
